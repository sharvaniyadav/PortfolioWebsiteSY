            <h3>Predictive Maintenance & Aerospace Part Disassembly</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning model to optimize aerospace part disassembly processes. 
                By implementing ensemble models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
                the model achieved 96% classification accuracy. 
                Performance was further enhanced by 40% using hyperparameter optimization techniques, 
                including GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
            </p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Automated Visual Inspection of Aircraft Skin Defects</h3>
            <p>
                Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify aircraft skin defects, including cracks, 
                dents, and missing screws. The system achieved 98% accuracy by leveraging TensorFlow and techniques 
                like Conv2D and MaxPooling2D. The ImageDataGenerator class was used for data augmentation, 
                improving defect detection reliability. This project significantly enhanced the efficiency of maintenance operations.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Automated Component Detection in PCB Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>
                Designed an automated computer vision system for verifying PCB (Printed Circuit Board) component placement 
                using the YOLOv8 object detection model. By fine-tuning the YOLOv8 hyperparameters, the system achieved 
                94% detection accuracy and reduced manual inspection time by 30%, leading to improved manufacturing efficiency.

            <h3>3D CAD Model of B777-300ER</h3>
            <p>
                Designed and modeled a 3D replica of the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft featuring Air Canadaâ€™s new livery. 
                Doors, wings, and engines were modeled as separate components in SolidWorks and later assembled. 
                The final design was rendered in Photo View 360, providing a highly realistic visualization of the aircraft.

            <h3>Design of a Morphable Rib for a Flexible Trailing Edge</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a flexible rib structure for integration into winglets, aimed at creating a "Flexible Trailing Edge" 
                to improve aerodynamic adaptability and efficiency. The design, implemented in SolidWorks, increased 
                aerodynamic efficiency by 350%-450%. Simulations and tests ensured its reliability under various flight conditions.
